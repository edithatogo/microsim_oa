# Investigation and Resolution Plan: `renv` Segmentation Fault

**Date:** 2025-08-13

## 1. Problem Description

A segmentation fault occurs when running `devtools::check()`. The traceback indicates the crash happens within the `renv` package during dependency discovery, specifically when analyzing a call related to `ggplot2::ggsave`. This is a low-level memory error, suggesting a potential bug in `renv` or a package version incompatibility.

**Error:** `*** caught segfault *** address 0x73a2dbe3c928, cause 'memory not mapped'`

**Traceback Highlight:** `renv_call_expect(node, "ggplot2", "ggsave")`

## 2. Objective

Resolve the segmentation fault to allow `devtools::check()` to complete successfully, ensuring the integrity and reproducibility of the project's R environment.

## 3. Synthesized Strategy

The problem lies within the project's tooling (`renv`), not the project's own logic. The strategy combines software engineering best practices and targeted debugging to isolate, understand, and mitigate the issue efficiently.

- **Isolate:** Pinpoint the exact code causing the crash.
- **Investigate:** Check for existing solutions and version conflicts.
- **Mitigate:** Implement a workaround to unblock development if an immediate fix is not available.
- **Document:** Keep a record of the investigation for future reference.

## 4. Detailed Action Plan

### Step 1: Identify the Triggering Code
- **Action:** Search the entire project for calls to `ggplot2::ggsave` or `ggsave` to find the file(s) `renv` is struggling to parse.
- **Tool:** `search_file_content`
- **Command:** `search_file_content(pattern="ggsave", include="**/*.R*")`

### Step 2: Check for Known Issues & Version Conflicts
- **Action:** Read the `renv.lock` file to identify the exact versions of `renv`, `ggplot2`, and `devtools` being used.
- **Tool:** `read_file`
- **Command:** `read_file(absolute_path="/home/doughnut/github/aus_oa_public/renv.lock")`
- **Action:** Search for known issues online related to `renv` segfaults and `ggsave`.
- **Tool:** `google_web_search`
- **Command:** `google_web_search(query="renv segmentation fault ggplot2 ggsave")`

### Step 3: Attempt Package Updates
- **Action:** As a potential quick fix, attempt to update the core packages involved to their latest versions from CRAN. This may resolve the issue if it was a bug in an older version.
- **Tool:** `run_shell_command`
- **Command:** `Rscript -e "update.packages(c('renv', 'ggplot2', 'devtools'), ask = FALSE)"`
- **Verification:** After updating, re-run the failing command: `Rscript -e "devtools::check()"`

### Step 4: Isolate with a Minimal Reproducible Example (MRE)
- **Action:** If updating packages fails, create a small, self-contained R script that uses `ggsave` in the same way as the identified file. This helps confirm the trigger and is useful for bug reporting.
- **Tool:** `write_file` to create `debug/mre_ggsave.R`.
- **Action:** Run `renv` dependency analysis on just this file.
- **Tool:** `run_shell_command`
- **Command:** `Rscript -e "renv::dependencies('debug/mre_ggsave.R')"`

### Step 5: Mitigation via `.renvignore` (If Necessary)
- **Action:** If the issue persists and a fix is not readily available, the most pragmatic solution is to instruct `renv` to ignore the problematic file(s). This unblocks the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Tool:** `read_file` to get current `.renvignore` content.
- **Tool:** `write_file` to append the path of the problematic file to `.renvignore`.
- **Documentation:** Add a comment in `.renvignore` explaining why the file is being ignored. This is a form of documented technical debt.

### Step 6: Final Verification
- **Action:** After applying the fix or workaround, run the original command again to confirm the issue is resolved.
- **Tool:** `run_shell_command`
- **Command:** `Rscript -e "devtools::check()"`
