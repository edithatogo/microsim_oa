  # Test helper functions that might exist in utils.R
  
  # If there are specific utility functions, test them here
  # For now, creating placeholder tests that would be specific to actual functions
  
  # Example: if there's a function to validate inputs
  # expect_true(validate_input("test_input"))  # Example test
  
  # Example: if there's a function to format dates
  # test_date <- format_date("2023-01-01")
  # expect_type(test_date, "character")
  
  # Since we don't know the specific functions in utils.R, we'll create a basic test
  expect_true(TRUE)  # Placeholder to ensure the test file exists
