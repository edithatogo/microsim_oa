#' Calculate Costs for a Simulation Cycle
#'
#' This function calculates various costs for each individual in the attribute
#' matrix based on events that occurred in the current cycle and ongoing states.
#' It uses a detailed, component-based cost configuration.
#'
#' @param am_new A data.table representing the attribute matrix with the
#'   latest events for the current cycle.
#' @param costs_config A list containing the detailed cost parameters from the
#'   model configuration file.
#'
#' @return The `am_new` data.table with new columns for costs incurred
#'   during the cycle, broken down by perspective.
#' @import data.table
#' @export
