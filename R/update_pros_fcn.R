#' Update Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs)
#'
#' This function updates the pain and function scores for each individual in
#' the attribute matrix based on events in the current cycle.
#'
#' @param am_new A data.table representing the attribute matrix with the
#'   latest events for the current cycle.
#' @param cycle.coefficents A list of model coefficients.
#'
#' @return The `am_new` data.table with updated `pain` and `function_score` columns.
#' @export
