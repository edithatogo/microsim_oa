# Welcome to AUS-OA {-}

The AUS-OA (Australian Osteoarthritis) microsimulation model is a sophisticated tool for modeling the progression of osteoarthritis and evaluating health economic outcomes in the Australian population. This documentation provides comprehensive information about the model's architecture, implementation, and usage.

## Overview

AUS-OA is a dynamic discrete-time microsimulation model designed to evaluate osteoarthritis health economics and policy interventions in Australia. The model simulates individual life trajectories with respect to osteoarthritis progression, treatment interventions, and economic outcomes.

## Intended Audience

This documentation is intended for:

- Researchers wanting to understand the model architecture
- Policymakers evaluating health interventions
- Developers looking to extend the model
- Users wanting to run simulations

## Document Structure

This book is organized as follows:

- Chapter 1: Introduction to the model
- Chapter 2: Model architecture and components
- Chapter 3: Data requirements and input formats
- Chapter 4: Running simulations
- Chapter 5: Model validation and results
- Chapter 6: Extending the model
- Chapter 7: Troubleshooting and support
