## Healthcare Utilization Concepts

### Key Metrics

1. **Utilization Rates**: Number of healthcare contacts per person per time period
2. **Cost Analysis**: Direct and indirect healthcare costs
3. **Service Mix**: Distribution of healthcare services used
4. **Access Disparities**: Differences in utilization across population groups
5. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Value for money in healthcare interventions

### Australian Healthcare Context

## Key Takeaways

1. **Utilization Patterns**: Healthcare utilization varies significantly by age, sex, and geographic location
2. **Cost Distribution**: Healthcare costs are highly skewed with a small proportion of patients accounting for most costs
3. **Access Disparities**: Socioeconomic and geographic factors influence healthcare access and utilization
4. **Cost Drivers**: Hospitalizations and specialist visits are major cost drivers
5. **Policy Implications**: Understanding utilization patterns informs resource allocation and intervention strategies

## Next Steps

- **Tutorial 3**: Longitudinal disease progression modeling
- **Tutorial 4**: Geographic health disparities analysis
- **Advanced Topics**: Machine learning for utilization prediction, advanced cost-effectiveness analysis
