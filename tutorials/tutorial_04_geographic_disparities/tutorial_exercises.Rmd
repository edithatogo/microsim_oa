## Exercise 1: Loading and Exploring Geographic Health Data

### 1.1 Load Geographic Health Data

Load the synthetic geographic health dataset and examine its structure.

library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(spdep)
library(spatialreg)
library(leaflet)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Geographic Patterns**: Health outcomes show significant geographic variation across Australian states and territories
2. **Access Disparities**: Distance to healthcare services strongly influences utilization and outcomes
3. **Socioeconomic Factors**: Income, education, and employment status correlate with geographic health disparities
4. **Spatial Clustering**: Health outcomes tend to cluster geographically, indicating spatial autocorrelation
5. **Policy Implications**: Geographic analysis informs targeted healthcare resource allocation and policy development

## Next Steps

- **Advanced Spatial Methods**: Learn spatial regression and geographically weighted regression
- **Real Geographic Data**: Apply techniques to actual Australian health datasets
- **Interactive Mapping**: Create web-based interactive health maps
- **Temporal Geographic Analysis**: Analyze how geographic patterns change over time
