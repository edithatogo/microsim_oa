## Exercise 1: Loading and Exploring Geographic Health Data

### 1.1 Load Geographic Health Data

Load the synthetic geographic health dataset and examine its structure.

```r
# Load required packages
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(spdep)
library(spatialreg)
library(leaflet)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(scales)
library(aus_oa_public)
set.seed(12345)

# Load geographic health data
geographic_data <- readRDS("data/geographic_health_data.rds")

# Alternative: Load from CSV
# geographic_data <- read_csv("data/geographic_health_data.csv")
```

### 1.2 Examine Geographic Data Structure

Explore the structure and characteristics of geographic health data.

```r
# View dataset dimensions and structure
dim(geographic_data)
str(geographic_data)
summary(geographic_data)

# Check geographic distribution
table(geographic_data$state)
table(geographic_data$remoteness_area)

# Check data completeness by state
geographic_data %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise(
    n_patients = n(),
    pct_oa = mean(osteoarthritis, na.rm = TRUE) * 100,
    mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_income = mean(household_income, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(n_patients))
```

### 1.3 Geographic Data Quality Assessment

## Key Takeaways

1. **Geographic Patterns**: Health outcomes show significant geographic variation across Australian states and territories
2. **Access Disparities**: Distance to healthcare services strongly influences utilization and outcomes
3. **Socioeconomic Factors**: Income, education, and employment status correlate with geographic health disparities
4. **Spatial Clustering**: Health outcomes tend to cluster geographically, indicating spatial autocorrelation
5. **Policy Implications**: Geographic analysis informs targeted healthcare resource allocation and policy development

## Next Steps

- **Advanced Spatial Methods**: Learn spatial regression and geographically weighted regression
- **Real Geographic Data**: Apply techniques to actual Australian health datasets
- **Interactive Mapping**: Create web-based interactive health maps
- **Temporal Geographic Analysis**: Analyze how geographic patterns change over time
