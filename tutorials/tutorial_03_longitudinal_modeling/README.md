# Tutorial 3: Longitudinal Disease Progression Modeling

## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates advanced longitudinal disease progression modeling techniques using time-series health data. It covers survival analysis, mixed effects models, time-series analysis, trajectory clustering, and predictive modeling for health outcomes.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this tutorial, you will learn to:

1. **Analyze longitudinal health data patterns** - Understand temporal trends and correlations in health outcomes
2. **Build survival models** - Use Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models for disease progression
3. **Apply mixed effects models** - Account for correlation within subjects over time
4. **Perform time-series analysis** - Use ARIMA models for forecasting health outcomes
5. **Identify patient trajectories** - Use clustering to find distinct progression patterns
6. **Develop predictive models** - Build models for disease progression and risk stratification
7. **Create advanced visualizations** - Use spaghetti plots, survival curves, and longitudinal profiles

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Tutorials 1 and 2
- Understanding of basic statistical concepts
- Familiarity with R programming
- Basic knowledge of time-series concepts (helpful but not required)
