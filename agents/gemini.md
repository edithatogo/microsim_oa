## Plan to Address `devtools::check()` Feedback (2025-08-12)

Based on a simulated review of the `devtools::check()` output, the following multi-phase plan was developed to enhance project stability, correctness, and maintainability.

### Phase 1: Immediate Stabilization & Correctness
- [x] **Synchronize `renv` Environment:** Use `renv::status()` and `renv::restore()` to ensure a reproducible environment.
- [x] **Fix Failing Test:** Debug and correct the logical error in `Stats_per_simulation_fcn.R` where `numeric_stats$N` is `0.0` instead of `4.0`.

### Phase 2: Warnings and Project Hygiene
- [x] **Document Undocumented Argument:** Add documentation for the `colors` argument in `man/f_plot_distribution.Rd`.
- [x] **Clean Project Root:** Update `.Rbuildignore` to exclude non-package files and directories from the build.
- [x] **Fix Non-Portable File Name:** Rename the long-named `.xlsx` file in `supporting_data/raw_data/`.
- [x] **Investigate Makefile Warning:** Check for updates to the `httpuv` dependency to resolve the GNU Makefile extensions warning.

### Phase 3: Strategic Improvements
- [x] **Data Portability Strategy:** Add an item to `planning/ROADMAP_v3.md` to evaluate replacing `.rds` files with a more portable format.
- [x] **Formalize CI/CD Process:** Review `.github/workflows/` and propose adding a `devtools::check()` step to the main workflow to act as a quality gate.
