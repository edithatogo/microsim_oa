# Parallel Processing Implementation

## Overview

I've already implemented comprehensive parallel processing capabilities in the AUS-OA package through the R/parallel_processing.R file. The implementation includes:

1. Parallel simulation execution for multiple scenarios
2. Parallel cost calculations
3. Parallel bootstrap analysis
4. Parallel cohort analysis
5. Parallel PSA (Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis)

Let me create a guide for using the parallel processing features:
