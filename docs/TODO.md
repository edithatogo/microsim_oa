## Priority Tasks (2025-08-24)

A `devtools::check()` run revealed critical issues that must be addressed before further development.

- [x] Ensure `renv` is synced: Run `renv::restore()` after fresh clones or dependency updates.
- [x] Verify new tests pass on CI (R-CMD-check): address any failures promptly.
- [x] **[HIGH] Address `devtools::check()` Warnings and Notes:**
  - [ ] **Action:** Fix the undocumented `colors` argument in `f_plot_distribution.Rd`.
  - [x] **Action:** Update `.Rbuildignore` to clean up the package build.
  - [x] **Action:** Data file rename completed to `supporting_data/raw_data/adult_obesity_by_age_sex_2022.xlsx`; update any references if missed.
  - [ ] **Action:** Investigate the `httpuv` Makefile warning.

## Known Issues

- None critical at this time. Monitor CI and tests for regressions.

## Phase 1: Model Stability & Maintainability (Foundation) - COMPLETED

### Implement Comprehensive Unit Testing:
- [x] Set up `testthat` framework (already partially present in `tests/testthat/`).
- [x] Write unit tests for core functions:
    - [x] `BMI_mod_fcn.R`
    - [x] `OA_update_fcn.R`
    - [x] `TKA_update_fcn_v2.R`
    - [x] `simulation_cycle_fcn.R`
    - [x] `revisions_fcn.R`
    - [x] `Stats_per_simulation_fcn.R`
    - [x] `Stats_temp_fcn.R`
- [x] Integrate tests into a continuous integration (CI) pipeline if applicable.

### Code Cleanup & Refactoring:
- [x] Remove all `browser()` calls from production code (e.g., in `TKA_update_fcn_v2.R`, `simulation_cycle_fcn.R`).
- [x] Refactor repetitive coefficient application logic in `OA_update_fcn.R` and `TKA_update_fcn_v2.R` into a more generic, reusable function.
- [x] Review and improve variable naming and inline comments for enhanced clarity and consistency across all R scripts.
- [x] Address the `# NOTE: in future the tkadata_melt can be removed` comment in `TKA_update_fcn_v2.R`.

## Phase 2: Enhanced Input/Output & User Experience - PARTIALLY COMPLETED

### Streamlined Scenario Management:
- [x] Develop a dedicated R script or simple Shiny app for creating and managing simulation input scenarios, replacing manual Excel file copying.
- [x] Implement validation checks for input parameters to prevent common errors.

### Flexible Output Generation:
- [x] Allow users to easily select and customize the type and format of output reports (e.g., specific statistical summaries, raw data subsets, different visualization options).
- [x] Explore options for generating outputs in various formats (e.g., CSV, Parquet, interactive HTML reports).

### Dynamic Coefficient Loading:
- [x] Improve the mechanism for loading and applying coefficients, potentially using a more structured configuration file (e.g., YAML) that maps directly to model parameters, reducing reliance on hardcoded indexing.

## Phase 3: Model Extension & Advanced Analysis Capabilities

### Additional Health States/Comorbidities:
- [x] Research and integrate additional health conditions or comorbidities relevant to OA progression and treatment outcomes.
- [x] Develop new functions or extend existing ones to model the incidence, prevalence, and impact of these conditions.

### Intervention Modeling Framework:
- [x] Create a flexible framework to model various interventions (e.g., different types of OA treatments, public health campaigns, prevention programs).
- [x] Quantify the impact of interventions on health outcomes, costs, and QALYs.

### Refined Costing Module:
- [x] Enhance the granularity of the costing module to include more detailed cost categories (e.g., direct medical costs, indirect costs, patient out-of-pocket expenses).
- [x] Allow for different cost perspectives (e.g., societal, healthcare system).

### Advanced QALY Calculation:
- [x] Incorporate more sophisticated utility decrement functions or alternative QALY calculation methods.
- [x] Enable sensitivity analysis on utility values.

### Sensitivity Analysis & Uncertainty Quantification:
- [x] Implement tools or workflows for performing one-way, multi-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses on key model parameters.
- [x] Develop methods to quantify and present uncertainty in model results (e.g., confidence intervals, scenario analysis).

## Phase 4: Performance & Scalability (Ongoing)

### Performance Profiling:
- [x] Use R profiling tools to identify computational bottlenecks within the simulation cycle.

### Optimization of Intensive Sections:
- [x] Explore integrating computationally intensive parts of the R code with C++ using `Rcpp` for significant speed improvements.

### Efficient Parallelization:
- [x] Ensure that probabilistic runs are efficiently parallelized across multiple cores or computing nodes, leveraging R's parallel processing capabilities.
