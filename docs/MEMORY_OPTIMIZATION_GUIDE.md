# Memory Management and Optimization

## Overview

This enhancement addresses memory management and optimization in the AUS-OA package. The key improvements include:

1. Efficient data.table operations
2. Memory-conscious algorithm design
3. Optimal data storage formats
4. Reduced memory footprint through optimization

## Implementation

I've already implemented memory management optimizations through:
- The memory optimization functions in R/memory_optimization.R
- Optimized data.table operations in various functions
- Efficient batch processing for large datasets
- Column reduction and type optimization utilities

Let me create a memory optimization guide:
