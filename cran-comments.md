# CRAN Comments for ausoa v2.0.0

## Test environments
- R version 4.3.3 (2024-02-29)
- Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)
- Running under: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

## Downstream dependencies
None.

## Special considerations

### Package Purpose
This package implements a comprehensive microsimulation model of osteoarthritis in Australia, including disease progression, treatment pathways, cost-effectiveness analysis, and policy evaluation.

### Data and File Dependencies
- The package includes example configuration files in `inst/config/`
- Test data files are included in `inst/extdata/`
- The package uses external data files for model initialization (referenced in tests)

### Computational Requirements
- The simulation model can be computationally intensive for large populations
- Parallel processing is supported but not required
- Memory usage scales with population size and simulation cycles

### External Dependencies
- Uses `renv` for reproducible environments (not included in CRAN package)
- Depends on standard CRAN packages for data manipulation and visualization
- No system dependencies beyond standard R installation

### Testing
- Comprehensive test suite with 157+ tests
- Tests use example data included in the package
- Some tests may take several seconds to run due to simulation complexity

### Vignettes
- Includes a getting started vignette demonstrating basic usage
- Vignette builds successfully and passes R CMD check

## Resubmission Notes
This is the first submission of ausoa v2.0.0 to CRAN.
