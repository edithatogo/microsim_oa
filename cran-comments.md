# CRAN Comments for ausoa v2.2.1

## Test environments
- R version 4.3.3 (2024-02-29)
- Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)
- Running under: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS

## R CMD check results
This is a resubmission. In the previous submission, there were issues with:
- Test failures due to optional dependencies not being available during CRAN checks
- Undeclared package imports
- Non-standard files included in the package
- NEWS.md format issues

All issues have been addressed:
- Moved optional dependencies (caret, pROC) to Suggests
- Added proper imports for all used functions
- Excluded non-standard files via .Rbuildignore
- Fixed NEWS.md format

## Downstream dependencies
None.

## Special considerations

### Package Purpose
This package implements a comprehensive microsimulation model of osteoarthritis in Australia, including disease progression, treatment pathways, cost-effectiveness analysis, and policy evaluation.

### New Features in v2.2.1 - CRAN Compliance Update
- **CRAN Submission Fixes**: Resolved all ERRORs and WARNINGs from previous submission
- **Dependency Management**: Moved packages to appropriate Imports/Suggests sections
- **Import Declarations**: Added comprehensive imports for stats, utils, and external packages
- **File Organization**: Excluded non-standard development files from package build
- **Documentation**: Fixed NEWS.md format and updated submission comments

### Data and File Dependencies
- The package includes example configuration files in `inst/config/`
- Test data files are included in `inst/extdata/`
- The package uses external data files for model initialization (referenced in tests)
- Documentation files in `docs/` directory for dataset integration guides

### Computational Requirements
- The simulation model can be computationally intensive for large populations
- Parallel processing is supported but not required
- Memory usage scales with population size and simulation cycles

### External Dependencies
- Uses `renv` for reproducible environments (not included in CRAN package)
- Depends on standard CRAN packages for data manipulation and visualization
- No system dependencies beyond standard R installation

### Testing
- Comprehensive test suite with 157+ tests
- Tests use example data included in the package
- Some tests may take several seconds to run due to simulation complexity

### Vignettes
- Includes a getting started vignette demonstrating basic usage
- Vignette builds successfully and passes R CMD check

## Resubmission Notes
This addresses the issues identified in the previous CRAN submission of ausoa v2.2.0. All ERRORs and WARNINGs have been resolved, and NOTEs have been addressed where appropriate.
