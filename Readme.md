## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   R (version 4.0.0 or higher)
-   RStudio (recommended)

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    `ash
    git clone https://github.com/edithatogo/microsim_oa.git
    cd microsim_oa
    `

2.  **Install dependencies:** This project uses 
env to manage dependencies. Open the AUS-OA.Rproj file in RStudio, and 
env should automatically start installing the required packages. If not, run the following command in the R console:
    `
    renv::restore()
    `

### Running a Simulation

1.  **Create a scenario:** Navigate to input/scenarios/ and copy an existing scenario file (e.g., usoa_input_public.xlsx). Rename it to something descriptive (e.g., my_scenario.xlsx).
2.  **Customize the scenario:** Open your new scenario file and modify the parameters as needed.
3.  **Run the master script:** Open and run the scripts/00_AUS_OA_Master.R script in R. You will be prompted to select your scenario file.
The simulation will run, and the outputs will be saved in the output/ directory.

## Project Structure

-   R/: Contains the core functions of the simulation model.
-   scripts/: Contains scripts for running the simulation, preprocessing data, and analyzing results.
-   input/: Contains input data for the model, including population data and simulation scenarios.
-   output/: Contains the outputs from the simulation, including logs, model statistics, and figures.
-   config/: Contains configuration files for the model, such as coefficients and intervention parameters.
-   man/: Contains documentation for the functions in the R/ directory.
-   	ests/: Contains unit tests for the model, using the 	estthat framework.
-   supporting_data/: Contains data used for model validation.

## Development

This project uses a structured development approach:

-   **Dependency Management:** 
env is used to ensure a reproducible environment.
-   **Testing:** 	estthat is used for unit testing. You can run the tests using the 
un_tests.R script in the scripts/ directory.
-   **Style:** A consistent code style is encouraged.
-   **Quality Control:** Enterprise-grade CI/CD with multi-platform testing, performance benchmarking, security scanning, and automated quality metrics.

### Quality Control

Run the full quality control suite:

`ash
# Run all tests
Rscript run_test.R

# Run linting
Rscript run_lintr.R

# Build documentation
Rscript build_docs.R

# Check package
Rscript -e "devtools::check()"

# Run performance tests
Rscript -e "source('tests/testthat/test-performance.R')"
`

### Debugging options

-   To surface a warning when a zero-length mortality hazard is encountered during a cycle (default is silent fallback to 1.0), set:
    `
    options(ausoa.warn_zero_length_hr_mort = TRUE)
    `
    This can help diagnose missing coefficients or filtered data situations in custom runs.

## Public Datasets for Model Development

AUS-OA supports integration with publicly available osteoarthritis datasets for model calibration, validation, and expansion. The following documentation provides guidance on using external data sources:

### Dataset Documentation Overview
- **docs/DATASET_DOCUMENTATION_OVERVIEW.md**: Complete overview of all dataset documentation and integration resources
- **docs/OA_DATASETS_QUICK_GUIDE.md**: Quick reference guide to the most accessible OA datasets
- **docs/PUBLIC_OA_DATASETS.md**: Comprehensive catalog of 50+ public OA datasets
- **docs/OA_DATASETS_SUMMARY.md**: Summary table of all datasets with key characteristics
- **docs/DATA_INTEGRATION_EXAMPLES.md**: Practical examples of integrating datasets with AUS-OA

### Key Datasets for Immediate Use
1. **Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)**: Primary clinical calibration dataset
2. **NHANES**: Population-level validation data
3. **ClinicalTrials.gov**: Treatment effectiveness data
4. **UK Biobank**: Genetic epidemiology data
5. **GWAS Catalog**: Genetic risk factors

### Getting Started with External Data
`
# Load and integrate external OA dataset
library(ausoa)
external_data <- read.csv("path/to/oa_dataset.csv")

# Map to AUS-OA format
aus_oa_data <- map_external_data(external_data)

# Run simulation with external data
results <- run_simulation(
  population = aus_oa_data,
  cycles = 10,
  config = load_config()
)
`

For detailed integration examples and data format specifications, see the dataset documentation in the docs/ directory.
