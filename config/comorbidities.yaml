# --- Comorbidity Modelling Configuration ---

# Set 'enabled' to true to include comorbidities in the simulation.
# If false, the entire comorbidity update step will be skipped.
enabled: false

# --- Conditions ---
# Parameters are based on a combination of literature review and modeling assumptions.
# Incidence rates for the general population are adjusted by prevalence ratios
# in OA patients where available from Swain et al. (2020).
# Costs and QALYs are estimates from various Australian sources.
