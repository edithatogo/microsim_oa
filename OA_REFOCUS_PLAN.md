# AUS-OA Repository Refocus Plan: OA Health Economics Focus

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the revised plan to refocus the AUS-OA repository on osteoarthritis (OA) health economics while preserving essential features that are actually core to OA modeling. The plan maintains ~80% of current functionality while removing only truly generic frameworks.

## Current Repository Assessment

**Total Files:** ~150
**Current Focus:** Broad health economics with OA specialization
**Issue:** Some features marked as "general" are actually core to OA economics

**Status:** Adapt to emphasize OA applications

### ‚ùå REMOVE: Truly Generic Features (20% of Repository)

#### 1. Reinforcement Learning Framework
**Files:** `R/reinforcement_learning.R` (769 lines)
**Status:** ‚ùå REMOVE - Generic RL not specific to OA
**Reason:** Generic framework applicable to any disease, not OA-specific

#### 2. General Bayesian Calibration
**Files:** `R/bayesian_calibration.R` (content TBD)
**Status:** ‚ùå REMOVE - Generic calibration framework
**Reason:** Generic Bayesian methods, keep OA-specific parameter estimation

#### 3. Advanced Analytics (Generic)
**Files:** `R/advanced_analytics.R` (content TBD)
**Status:** ‚ùå REMOVE - Generic analytics framework
**Reason:** Generic statistical methods, keep OA-specific analytics

#### 4. General Comorbidities (Non-OA Related)
**Files:** `R/update_comorbidities_fcn.R` (83 lines)
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL REMOVE
**Keep:** OA-related comorbidities (diabetes, cardiovascular disease)
**Remove:** Non-OA comorbidities (cancer, mental health, etc.)

## Implementation Timeline
