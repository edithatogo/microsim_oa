\description{
This module implements detailed modeling of public vs private healthcare pathways
in the Australian healthcare system. It models differences in:
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Access and waiting times
\item Treatment quality and outcomes
\item Costs and cost-effectiveness
\item Resource utilization
\item Patient satisfaction and experience
}

Key Features:
\itemize{
\item Pathway-specific outcome modifiers
\item Cost differential modeling
\item Quality of care adjustments
\item Access and equity considerations
\item Integration with existing simulation framework
}

Australian Healthcare Context:
\itemize{
\item Public system: Universal coverage, longer waits, standardized care
\item Private system: Faster access, choice of provider, potential quality differences
\item Mixed system: Patients can choose or be directed to different pathways
Calculate Pathway-Specific Outcome Modifiers
}
