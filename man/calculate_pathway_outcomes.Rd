\description{
This module implements detailed modeling of public vs private healthcare pathways
in the Australian healthcare system. It models differences in:
}
\details{
- Access and waiting times
- Treatment quality and outcomes
- Costs and cost-effectiveness
- Resource utilization
- Patient satisfaction and experience

Key Features:
- Pathway-specific outcome modifiers
- Cost differential modeling
- Quality of care adjustments
- Access and equity considerations
- Integration with existing simulation framework

Australian Healthcare Context:
- Public system: Universal coverage, longer waits, standardized care
- Private system: Faster access, choice of provider, potential quality differences
- Mixed system: Patients can choose or be directed to different pathways
