\description{
This module implements advanced waiting list dynamics for the AUS-OA microsimulation model.
It models patient prioritization, queue management, capacity constraints, and wait time impacts
on clinical outcomes and costs.
}
\details{
Key Features:
\itemize{
\item Clinical prioritization based on urgency scores
\item Queue management with capacity constraints
\item Wait time impacts on outcomes (progression of OA, QALY loss)
\item Different prioritization schemes (clinical need, age, socioeconomic factors)
\item Public vs private pathway considerations
}
