calculate_urgency_score(am_curr, prioritization_scheme = "clinical")
}
\arguments{
\item{am_curr}{Current attribute matrix}

\description{
This module implements advanced waiting list dynamics for the AUS-OA microsimulation model.
It models patient prioritization, queue management, capacity constraints, and wait time impacts
on clinical outcomes and costs.
}
\details{
Key Features:
- Clinical prioritization based on urgency scores
- Queue management with capacity constraints
- Wait time impacts on outcomes (progression of OA, QALY loss)
- Different prioritization schemes (clinical need, age, socioeconomic factors)
- Public vs private pathway considerations

Clinical References:
- Australian Orthopaedic Association guidelines
- NICE osteoarthritis guidelines
- Health system capacity modeling literature
- Wait time impact studies
