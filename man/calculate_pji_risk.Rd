\description{
This module implements advanced PJI modeling for the AUS-OA microsimulation model.
PJI is a serious complication following total knee arthroplasty with significant
clinical, economic, and quality of life impacts.
}
\section{Clinical Pathways}{

PJI is modeled through multiple stages:
\enumerate{
\item Early infection (<3 months post-surgery)
\item Delayed infection (3-12 months post-surgery)
\item Late infection (>12 months post-surgery)
\item Chronic infection (persistent/recurrent)
}
}

\section{Risk Factors}{

\itemize{
\item Age
\item BMI
\item Diabetes
\item Smoking
\item Immunosuppression
\item Surgical complexity
\item Previous infections
}
