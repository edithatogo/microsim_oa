\usage{
define_hospital_types()
}
\value{
List of hospital types with their characteristics
}
\description{
This module implements comprehensive resource allocation modeling for the
Australian healthcare system within the AUS-OA microsimulation framework.
}
\details{
Key Features:
\itemize{
\item Hospital capacity modeling by type (public/private, metro/regional)
\item Regional capacity variations and referral patterns
\item Dynamic capacity allocation based on demand
\item Resource utilization tracking
\item Capacity constraint impacts on wait times and outcomes
\item Integration with existing waiting list and pathways modules
}

Australian Healthcare Context:
\itemize{
\item Public hospitals: Government-funded, universal access, capacity constraints
\item Private hospitals: Fee-for-service, faster access, capacity varies by region
\item Regional variations: Metro areas have more capacity, rural areas have less
\item Referral patterns: Complex patients may be referred to specialized centers
