\value{
List of hospital types with their characteristics
}
\description{
This module implements comprehensive resource allocation modeling for the
Australian healthcare system within the AUS-OA microsimulation framework.
}
\details{
Key Features:
- Hospital capacity modeling by type (public/private, metro/regional)
- Regional capacity variations and referral patterns
- Dynamic capacity allocation based on demand
- Resource utilization tracking
- Capacity constraint impacts on wait times and outcomes
- Integration with existing waiting list and pathways modules

Australian Healthcare Context:
- Public hospitals: Government-funded, universal access, capacity constraints
- Private hospitals: Fee-for-service, faster access, capacity varies by region
- Regional variations: Metro areas have more capacity, rural areas have less
- Referral patterns: Complex patients may be referred to specialized centers
